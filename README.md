# pixelplanet-image-slider
I like this image slider. It's created based off of a few different styles that I've used before, and uses the Swiper library from npm. Created, as a side detour, because I'd like some way to view "Planets Visited" for the Odyssey Game Demo, and... still messing with it, but this one's close.
